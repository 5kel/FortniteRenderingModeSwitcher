# Fortnite Rendering Mode Switcher

Fortnite Rendering Mode Switcher: a set of batch files to quickly switch your Fortnite Rendering Mode

FAQ:

What does this do?:
- switch Fortnite Rendering Mode without having to open your game and restart it

How does it work?:
- by running the .bat file of your desired Rendering Mode, the needed strings in your GameUserSettings.ini file
   will automatically be replaced by the help of fart

Why would you need this?:
- if your game is currently closed and you want to play STW, but you know you currently have Performance Mode enabled, these will save you a few minutes of time

What if the included version of fart is modified?:
- if you don't trust me you can also just download fart from https://sourceforge.net/projects/fart-it/ and replace it
